## Prerequisites & System Requirements

Before installing and running the Uwazi backend, ensure your environment meets the necessary hardware and software requirements. This preparation avoids common setup issues and ensures smooth operation.

### Supported Hardware

Uwazi’s backend is designed to run on standard server hardware or cloud instances. To guarantee acceptable performance:

- Use a machine with at least 2 CPU cores.
- Allocate a minimum of 4 GB of RAM; 8 GB recommended for larger datasets.
- Ensure sufficient disk space for the document storage and indexes, at least 10 GB free.
- Network connectivity must allow inbound and outbound traffic on the configured ports.

### Software Requirements

The Uwazi backend depends on specific versions of language runtimes and package managers:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.x (LTS) is required. Earlier or later versions are not officially supported and may cause runtime errors.
- **npm**: Bundled with Node.js 18.x; ensure it is at least version 8.x.
- **Database**: A running instance of MongoDB 6.x or compatible is needed. The database must be accessible and configured for the app.

> Quick check: Run `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal to verify installed versions.

### Environment & Permissions

Uwazi runs in Node.js and requires proper environment setup:

- The user running Uwazi needs read/write access to the filesystem paths where Uwazi stores uploaded files and indexes.
- Environment variables such as `MONGO_URL` must be set correctly for database connection.
- Ports (default 3000 for HTTP) need to be open and not blocked by firewalls.
- On Linux servers, consider setting up process supervision (e.g., systemd) for stable uptime.

### Operating System Support

- Uwazi backend supports modern Linux distributions (Ubuntu 22.04 LTS recommended).
- MacOS and Windows can be used for development or testing but are not recommended for production.

### Common Setup Pitfalls

- Using unsupported Node.js or MongoDB versions causes start-up failures.
- Insufficient memory may cause unexpected crashes.
- File permission issues often lead to failures loading or saving documents.

<Tip>
Always confirm your environment versions with `node -v` and `mongod --version` before proceeding with installation. This saves troubleshooting time later.
</Tip>

### Verify Your Setup

After preparing your environment, quickly verify with these commands:

```bash
node -v  # Expected output: v18.x.x
npm -v   # Expected output: 8.x.x or higher
mongod --version  # Expected output: 6.x.x
```

If these commands fail or show incompatible versions, adjust your environment accordingly.

<Check>
Check that the directories for uploads and indexes are writable by the Uwazi user to avoid runtime errors.
</Check>

### Where to Go Next

Once your system matches these prerequisites, proceed to [Installation & Initial Configuration](/getting-started/uwazi-setup-essentials/installation-initial-configuration) to get Uwazi up and running quickly.
