# Starting Uwazi and Verifying Server Health

This guide helps you launch the Uwazi server for the first time and confirm that it’s running correctly. You’ll learn the basic commands to start the server, identify what a successful startup looks like in the output, and quickly validate the server’s responsiveness through simple API checks.

## Prerequisites Before Launch

Make sure you’ve completed the installation and initial configuration steps first. At minimum, you need:

- Uwazi installed and dependencies available (Node.js, MongoDB, etc.).
- Appropriate environment variables or configuration files set up (e.g., database URLs, port settings).
- Terminal access with permissions to run commands.

If you haven’t installed the server yet, see [Installation & Initial Configuration](/getting-started/uwazi-setup-essentials/installation-initial-configuration).

## Launching the Uwazi Server

Starting the Uwazi server is straightforward using the main server start command. This command boots the server on the configured port and connects to its database.

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Uwazi root directory">
Change to the directory where Uwazi is installed:

```bash
cd your_uwazi_installation_directory
```
</Step>
<Step title="Run the startup command">
Start the server with:

```bash
npm start
```

or if you use Yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This command launches the server based on the run configuration defined in `package.json`.
</Step>
<Step title="Watch for startup output">
You should see log lines confirming:

- Initialization of server components
- Successful connection to MongoDB
- Server listening on a network port (default: 3000)

Example snippet:

```
Uwazi server started on port 3000
Connected to MongoDB at mongodb://localhost:27017/uwazi
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## Validating the Server Is Running

After startup, verification is key before further configuration or use:

- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or your configured domain/port).
- You should see the Uwazi web interface homepage load.

Alternatively, you can check basic API responsiveness via curl:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:3000/api
```

A healthy server responds with status `200 OK` and JSON metadata indicating the API is live.

<Tip>
If your server doesn’t respond or you get connection errors:

- Verify MongoDB is running and accessible.
- Confirm your environment variables or configuration files have correct database connection info.
- Check for port conflicts or firewall restrictions.
</Tip>

## What to Expect and Common Pitfalls

The startup output is your primary feedback:

- **Missing Database Connection:** Look for errors mentioning MongoDB connection failures.
- **Port Already in Use:** Errors will indicate the chosen port is occupied.
- **Configuration Errors:** Invalid or missing env vars show up as startup warnings or failures.

Resolving these is often a matter of revisiting your setup or environment.

<Warning>
Don’t ignore errors in the startup logs — the server may appear running but won’t respond correctly without a healthy DB connection.
</Warning>

## Next Steps

Once the server runs and responds:

- Proceed to [Authentication & Authorization](/overview/core_concepts/authentication_overview) to secure your instance.
- Customize your settings via [Settings & Configuration Concepts](/overview/core_concepts/settings_and_configuration).
- If you hit issues, see [Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues](/getting-started/uwazi-setup-essentials/troubleshooting-common-setup-issues).
