## Settings APIs Overview

The Settings APIs let you programmatically read and update global application settings for your Uwazi deployment. These endpoints are your gateway to configuring system-wide behaviors, appearance, and integration options without manual changes via the UI or direct database access.

Keep in mind these APIs control sensitive, application-wide properties, so permission requirements are strict, and changes affect all users immediately.

## Authentication and Headers

All requests to these endpoints require a valid authentication token with administrative privileges. Typically, this means using a Bearer token obtained through the Authentication APIs.

Include these headers in your requests:

- `Authorization: Bearer <your_token>`
- `Content-Type: application/json`
- `Accept: application/json`

Example header block:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json
```

Without the correct privileges, API calls will return a 403 Forbidden.

## Core Endpoints

Focus your integration on these main endpoints to read and update settings:

### Get Current Settings
Retrieve the full set of application settings.

- **Method:** GET
- **Path:** `/api/settings`

**Example Request:**

```http
GET /api/settings HTTP/1.1
Host: your-uwazi-instance.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accept: application/json
```

**Successful Response Example:**
```json
{
  "store": {
    "features": {
      "email": true,
      "templates": {
        "enabled": true
      }
    },
    "ui": {
      "language": "en",
      "branding": {
        "logo": "/public/logo.png"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> The response delivers the whole configuration tree as stored internally. Only relevant or enabled settings will typically be present.

### Update Application Settings
Send updated settings to adjust the application's configuration.

- **Method:** PUT
- **Path:** `/api/settings`
- **Content-Type:** `application/json`

Only include keys you want to update; unspecified values remain untouched.

**Payload example:**

```json
{
  "store": {
    "ui": {
      "language": "es",
      "branding": {
        "logo": "/public/new-logo.png"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Example Request:**

```http
PUT /api/settings HTTP/1.1
Host: your-uwazi-instance.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "store": {
    "ui": {
      "language": "es"
    }
  }
}
```

**Successful Response:**
- HTTP 200 OK
- Returns the updated settings snapshot

> Quick note: Some settings require server restart or cache clearing to take effect fully. Check the UI or logs for such indications.

## Permission Requirements

- Only users with the `admin` role or equivalent permissions can access these endpoints.
- Attempts to read or update without sufficient permissions will result in a 403 Forbidden status.

## Common Pitfalls and Best Practices

- Always **fetch the current settings before updating** to avoid accidentally overwriting unrelated keys.
- Send only the keys you intend to change to minimize side effects.
- Use environment-specific tokens for different deployments to avoid confusion.
- If you need to change sensitive fields such as authentication providers or system integrations, double-check your payload carefully.

## Example Workflow for Updating UI Language

1. **Get current settings:**

```bash
curl -X GET https://your-uwazi-instance.com/api/settings \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -H 'Accept: application/json'
```

2. **Modify the UI language in the response data to your preferred one, e.g., "fr" (French).**

3. **PUT updated settings:**

```bash
curl -X PUT https://your-uwazi-instance.com/api/settings \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"store":{"ui":{"language":"fr"}}}'
```

4. **Verify response and test application UI language change.**

## Error Handling & Responses

- **401 Unauthorized:** Missing or invalid token.
- **403 Forbidden:** Token valid but insufficient privileges.
- **400 Bad Request:** Invalid payload format or invalid keys.

Example error response:

```json
{
  "message": "Forbidden",
  "statusCode": 403
}
```
